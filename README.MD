# CreeperHost/CommunitySchema

Hello there, enthusiastic developer! :wave:

Welcome to the **CreeperHost/CommunitySchema** repository. If you've ever dreamt of making various games or services work seamlessly with the CreeperHost panel and API, then you've stumbled upon the right place!

## :rocket: What's the Purpose of This Repo?

The primary goal of this repository is to host configuration files that allow CreeperHost's panel and API to initiate and run arbitrary games or other services. The magic happens when these configs integrate with the panel, offering full-fledged control and configuration support for a wide variety of games and services.

## :warning: Heads Up!

Although this repo provides the flexibility to integrate many games and services with the CreeperHost panel, there are a few things you should be aware of:

1. **No Direct Support:** We won't be offering direct support for the use of these services. This repo is more of a community-driven effort, where shared knowledge will be the primary mode of assistance.
   
2. **Manual Setup Required:** Every service or game configuration you see here will require a manual setup. So, a bit of technical know-how will come in handy when you're working with these configs.

## :handshake: Contribute to the Cause

We're always on the lookout for new games and services to be added, and we welcome your expertise in refining the existing ones. If you believe you've got something valuable to add or enhance, don't hesitate! Create a Pull Request (PR) and contribute to expanding the versatility of CreeperHost.

1. **Adding New Services:** Feel free to add config files for any new game or service that's not already present in the repository.
   
2. **Refining Existing Services:** If you notice room for improvement in any of the existing services, your insights will be invaluable. Submit a PR with the necessary refinements.

## :book: Getting Started

For those new to the CreeperHost environment, or for those looking to understand the structure and format of the config files, we recommend diving into our [Documentation](https://www.creeperhost.net/wiki/books/creeperpanel/page/adding-a-custom-service-to-the-panel). It's a treasure trove of information that'll guide you on the right path.

## :heart: Thank You!

Your interest and potential contributions mean the world to us. This repository is a testament to what a community can achieve when we come together. Let's make the CreeperHost experience better for everyone!

Happy gaming and coding! :video_game: :computer:
